                <p>Back in 1989, when professional coaching and mentoring in Europe was a new business practice, a group of 
                like-minded practitioners came to the view that there needed to be a common code of practice and shared ethical 
                base for coaches and mentors.</p>
                
                <p>This group included people who are now regarded as the pioneers and original thinkers of the profession, many of 
                whose books have become essential reading. Among them were David Megginson, David Clutterbuck, Eric Parsloe, Sir 
                John Whitmore, Myles Downey and Peter Bluckert. </p>

				<p>Their common bond was that not only were they themselves practitioners, they were also involved in training 
                coaches and mentors. They wanted their students to recognise and work to a shared ethical standard not only to 
                guide their practice but to enable people who employed them to be able to rely on this as a mark of quality.</p>
